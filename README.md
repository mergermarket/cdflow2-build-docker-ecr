# mergermarket/cdflow-build-docker-ecr

* [mergermarket/cdflow-build-docker-ecr on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mergermarket/cdflow2-build-docker-ecr).
* [mergermarket/cdflow-build-docker-ecr on GitHub](https://github.com/mergermarket/cdflow2-build-docker-ecr).

[cdflow2](https://developer-preview.acuris.com/opensource/cdflow2/) build plugin for building docker images and pushing them to [AWS ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/). Performs the following steps:

* Gets an auth token for ECR based on IAM credentials in the environment.
* Does a `docker login` with that auth token in order to allow a docker image to be pushed to the repo.
* Does a `docker build` to create a docker image from the `Dockerfile` in the root of the project.
* Does a `docker push` to push the image to the ECR repository.
* Provides an `image` release metadata key so the resulting docker image can be used from terraform - via a terraform map variable named the same as the build (i.e. the key under `builds` in the `cdflow.yaml` - "docker" is a good choice)

Requires a cdflow2 config container with support for providing ECR config - e.g. [mergermarket/cdflow2-config-acuris](https://hub.docker.com/r/mergermarket/cdflow2-config-acuris).

## Usage

### cdflow.yaml

This example uses `mergermarket/cdflow2-config-acuris`, which supports creating an ECR repository and providing the config for it as environment variables to the build (this config container is only suitable for developing within Acuris).

```yaml
version: 2
config:
  image: mergermarket/cdflow2-config-acuris
  params:
    account_prefix: myaccountprefix
    team: myteam
builds:
  docker:
    image: mergermarket/cdflow2-build-docker-ecr
    params:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      context: = .
      secrets:
        - "id=npmrc,src=.npmrc"
        - "id=ssh,src=/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
terraform:
  image: hashicorp/terraform
```

### Dockerfile

Will build a docker image from a Dockerfile in the root of the project. This could be anything, in this case a simple hello world.

```Dockerfile
FROM hello-world
```

### Parameters

#### dockerfile

Change the Dockerfile path used for the build.  
Default path is `Dockerfile` in the same directory as the `cdflow.yaml`.

#### context

Change the context of the build. A buildâ€™s context is the set of files located in the specified path.  
Defaults to `.`.

#### buildx

Use buildx for image creation with multi architecture support instead of the classic build command.  
Boolean parameter.  
Defaults to `false`.

#### platforms

Comma-separated list of platforms for the build, when buildx is enabled.  
E.g.: `linux/arm64,linux/386,linux/s390x`.  
Available platforms depends on the host and installed QEMU emulators.  
Check [https://github.com/tonistiigi/binfmt](https://github.com/tonistiigi/binfmt) for more info.  
If buildx not enabled, parameter ignored.  
Defaults to empty list.

#### cache-from

Import docker layer cache from specific source.  
Currently only "gha" supported.  
For supported options check: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/#cache-from.  
If buildx not enabled, parameter ignored.  
Defaults to empty string.

```yaml
  buildx:
    image: mergermarket/cdflow2-build-docker-ecr:latest
    params:
      buildx: true
      platforms: linux/arm64,linux/386
      cache-from: type=gha
      cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

#### secrets

Allow passing secrets to the docker build.
Secrets are passed as a list of strings.
Each string should be in the format
`id=<secret_id>,src=<secret_src>`

`<secret_id>` is the name of the secret that will be used in
the docker build context.

`<secret_src>` is the path to the secret file on the host machine.

limitation: It is only possible to pass src files, env is not available for cdflow2-build-docker-ecr plugin, as it runs in a separate container.

```yaml
  buildx:
    image: mergermarket/cdflow2-build-docker-ecr:latest
    params:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      context: = .
      secrets:
        - "id=npmrc,src=.npmrc"
        - "id=ssh,src=/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
```

#### cache-to

Export docker layer to specific destination.  
Currently only "gha" supported.  
For supported options check: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/#cache-from.  
If buildx not enabled, parameter ignored.  
Defaults to empty string.  

```yaml
  buildx:
    image: mergermarket/cdflow2-build-docker-ecr:latest
    params:
      buildx: true
      platforms: linux/arm64,linux/386
      cache-from: type=gha
      cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

## Config container support

Config containers that supports this build plugin are:

* [mergermarket/cdflow2-config-acuris](https://hub.docker.com/r/mergermarket/cdflow2-config-acuris).
* [mergermarket/cdflow2-config-aws-simple](https://github.com/mergermarket/cdflow2-config-aws-simple)

### Adding support in a config container

This container advertises a single `"ecr"` need when it is configured for a build. A config container in its `configureRelease` hook should ensure that an ECR repository exists and is provided in the environment, along with AWS credentials that can push to it and a region:

* `ECR_REPOSITORY` - the address of the repository of the form `<account-number>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repo-name>`)
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (for temporary credentials only)
* `AWS_REGION`
